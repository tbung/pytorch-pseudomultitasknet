# pseudo-multitask learning

Attempts to create an interesting feature space using multiple tasks for one
single network. Includes a reversible and thereby generative model.

## Requirements

- pytorch
- tqdm
- numpy

## TODO

- [ ] Add generative side loss
- [ ] Take a look at interpolation between samples
- [ ] Further improve net architecture
